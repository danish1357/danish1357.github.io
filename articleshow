		"Story": "GENEVA: When Ligi PK, a 48-year-old weaver in the small town of Chendamangalam in Kerala, is told that the stained piece of saree she is shaping into a doll is a global sensation of sorts, she is hardly surprised. Ligi has come a long way since August last year when devastating floods hit the southern state and wiped out houses and handloom machines in her town. She now makes over Rs 8,000 a month fashioning dolls out of handloom sarees sullied in the deluge, which she then puts in neat ready-to-be-shipped packages that will sell across India and beyond. \n\n<img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=69704595\" cap=\"‘Cheru’ means dirt and ‘kutty’ child, the fabric doll is story of those who overcame the dirt left behind by the flood\" imageid=\"69704595\" /> \nThousands of such boxes recently landed at a United Nations conference on disaster risk reduction in Geneva after the World Bank placed an order for them. Several delegates at the meeting last month were seen carrying miniature handmade dolls, evoking much curiosity. But it wasn’t just the dolls’ exquisiteness that piqued everyone’s interest, it was also their story— and that of Kerala’s — screened twice in the form of a documentary at the conference that won hearts. The dolls, popularly known as Chekutty dolls, have quickly risen to prominence as the mascot of a new Kerala rebuilding itself. \nWorkshops where thousands of volunteers have learned how to make Chekutty dolls have been held in the USA, Australia, Brazil, France and Germany since the past year. Gopinath Parayil, who owns a travel company in Kerala and founded the Chekutty Initiative with designer Lakshmi Menon, said that 50,000 volunteers in nine countries have raised more than $120,000 until now from sale of the dolls. “Over 270 workshops on Chekutty-making have been held in various countries,” said Parayil. \n\n<quote tn=\"quote\" au=\"Ligi PK, a 48-year-old weaver in the small town of Chendamangalam\" hl=\"At first, when they came to us, trying to buy spoiled stock of sarees, we thought they were crazy. But once they suggested we turn them into dolls to raise money, all of us agreed.\"></quote>\n\nParayil said the money thus raised has been donated to the weavers’ society. A six-metre saree produces 360 dolls, priced at Rs 25 each. “While a saree sells for Rs 1,300 apiece, 360 dolls made from a single saree fetch Rs 9,000,\" he said.\nThe idea to create the handmade dolls first struck Parayil when, after the floods, he saw weavers distraught as their stock of handloom sarees had been soiled by the water. “At that time, we had no idea the dolls would be such a hit.”\n\n<img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=69705190\" cap=\"Chekutty dolls from Chendamangalam — a flood ravaged small town in Ernakulam are a hit at global conferences\" imageid=\"69705190\" /> \nIn fact, the enthusiastic response to the workshops has got an Australia-based travel company to roll out tours to Chendamangalam where one can learn the art of Chekutty from weavers firsthand. Reena Tory, who runs a travel company in Sydney, has held Chekutty workshops in Australian universities and said that the response was overwhelming. “I was in Kerala after the floods and was inspired by the stories of resilience and camaraderie in wake of the disaster. Chekutty came across as a reflection of this spirit. People were so curious about the story behind these dolls that we decided to organise tours to Chendamangalam.”\n\n<video type=\"kaltura\" src=\"{\\\"vr\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/ne/1xnew7voul/hls/master.m3u8\\\",\\\"res\\\":\\\"auto\\\"},{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/ne/1xnew7voul/246aec35e9_F30_480p_900.mp4\\\",\\\"res\\\":\\\"480\\\"},{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/ne/1xnew7voul/246aec35e9_F40_360p_600.mp4\\\",\\\"res\\\":\\\"360\\\"},{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/ne/1xnew7voul/246aec35e9_F51_240p_256.mp4\\\",\\\"res\\\":\\\"240\\\"},{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/ne/1xnew7voul/246aec35e9_F60_144p_100.mp4\\\",\\\"res\\\":\\\"144\\\"},{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/ne/1xnew7voul/246aec35e9_F70_96p_48.mp4\\\",\\\"res\\\":\\\"80\\\"}]}\" id=\"1xnew7voul\" imageid=\"69711363\" caption=\"How Chekutty dolls resurrected a handloom village in Kerala\" cap=\"How Chekutty dolls resurrected a handloom village in Kerala\" su=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/how-chekutty-dolls-resurrected-a-handloom-village-in-kerala/videoshow/69711363.cms\" du=\"00:50\"></video>\nInternational institutions too have adopted these figurines and are using them to share a powerful narrative on how communities can overcome natural disasters. After showcasing the dolls at the conference by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) held between May 13-17, World Bank officials said the dolls may feature in their future conferences as well. \n\n<table>   <tr>   <td>boxcontent</td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td><strong>\n     <img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=69705014\" imageid=\"69705014\" />Chekutty dolls</strong>\n</td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>When floods hit Kerala in 2018, Chendamangalam Kaithari, the famed handloom from the state suffered a major blow\n</td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>Post floods, damaged, soiled sarees were collected, cleaned and made into cute dolls</td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>And from their resolve to rebuild their lives ‘Chekutty’ was born\n</td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>Idea was conceived and executed by Gopinath Parayil, and Lakshmi Menon, a designer along with help of thousands of volunteers\n</td>  </tr> </table>\nOne of the delegates at UNDRR who picked up some of the dolls was Lars Peter Nissen, director of ACAPS, a Geneva-based non-profit organisation. “The Chekutty dolls are so powerful because they carry stains and scars of a tragedy and yet they have empowered flood victims to rebuild their lives. They serve as a compelling example of how communities can come together to assist one another in case of a disaster. To me, they are also a reminder of how we as humanitarians must evolve and change the way we work in a world that will experience more frequent and more violent natural disasters,” he said. \n\n<quote tn=\"quote\" au=\"Lars Peter Nissen, director of ACAPS, a Geneva-based non-profit organisation\" hl=\"Chekutty dolls are so powerful because they carry stains and scars of a tragedy and yet they have empowered flood victims to rebuild their lives\"></quote>\nChekutty dolls are now set to widen their global presence, with the UNAIDS (UN Programme on HIV/AIDS) also placing an order for thousands of dolls for an event at the UN General Assembly in New York this year.\n\nElaborating on how the dolls came to be known as ‘Chekutty’, Parayil said that Che stands for Chendamangalam and Kutty for child. “Cheru in Malayalam also represents clay which came with the floods and destroyed everything, but those who overcame it are known as Chekutty,” he said. \n\n<img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=69711836\" cap=\"Workshops are being held worldwide where volunteers learn how to make Chekutty dolls\" imageid=\"69711836\" />\nAlmost a year after the deluge, the ‘Chekutty’ - the people who are the dolls’ namesake in Chendamangalam - are indeed getting their lives back on track as the textile industry is also on the path to revival.\n\n“At first, when Parayil and Lakshmi came to us, trying to buy spoiled stock of sarees, we thought they were crazy. But once they suggested we turn them into dolls to raise money, all of us agreed. Soon, we realised we were on to something bigger here. It wasn’t just some weavers making dolls, it was an entire community fighting back to regain all they had lost,” said Ligi. \n\n  <embed type=\"read_also\" id=\"67323771\" dlhref=\"toireaderactivities://t/a/67323771\" src=\"https://m.timesofindia.com/india/the-people-behind-the-the-mega-rescue-mission-during-the-kerala-floods/articleshow/67323771.cms\" hl=\"Kerala floods: How 4,500 fishermen in 700 boats rescued 65,000 in 3 days\" />\nAnd now that Karimpadom has almost exhausted its stock of flood-tainted fabric, weavers from panchayats of Cherai and Kuriyapilli have offered their tarnished handloom worth several lakhs to be turned into Chekutty — the dolls that lived.\n\n<em>Pic credit: R K Sreejith</em>\n",
